# FAQ
## How do I share it with my friends?
-   After authenticating, you can copy and paste the link to any contacts or group chat (please note that the link will expire in 1 hour from authenticating)

## I clicked my friend's link and it says 'Authenticate' at the top! What happened?
-   It may be that your friend didn't copy the link correctly or it is because that the link expires. The link expires after 1 hour from creating... Simply ask your friends to press authenticate again and share the link again.

## Wow, that's troublesome! I got to authenticate myself again?
-   Yes, in my effort to not log any data from you (the user), this is how the authentication process works. However, I am planning to create a new version of Spotifyer (called `Spotifier` that will not have any expired link(s)), However this requires me to collect some data which would be explained further on `Spotifier`
